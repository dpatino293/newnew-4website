<p>
Kevin Horton is my Tech Hero because we share similar backgrounds and goals. We both come from an underrepresented race, and we want to give back to the community. Kevin created the company Nomadd Group to help bring STEM to underprivileged schools. Kevin wants to give these students an opportunity to have a better future, by providing them with a proper education. I grew up attending Chicago Public Schools and saw from a first-person point of view how hard it was to have equal access to resources that private schools had. By challenging the disadvantages of marginalized groups, he is minimizing the wage gap between white people and non-white employees. Kevin also touches on the school-to-prison pipeline and is working towards preventing these disadvantages from continuing.
